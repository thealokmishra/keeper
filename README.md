# Keeper App 📝

A simple note-taking web application built using **React** to demonstrate core frontend concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and dynamic rendering.

This project is inspired by the basic functionality of Google Keep and is intended to showcase my understanding of React fundamentals. It is a **frontend-only application** with no backend or database integration at this stage.
